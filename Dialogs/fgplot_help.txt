FlightGear Fgplot
Contents

Fgplot has the intention to be a universal plotter module.
Plotting 6 lines with a user chosen step-size and resolution.
The curves are plotted from a set of 6 user-selectable properties.
      
The plotting of a line can be switched on/off by toggling the colored selector in the main fgplot-screen.   
      
Also transparency of the graph-field can be switched on/off this way.

Choose your curve from a property in the property-selector.

Only numbers will be plotted.
      
You can also choose the top-value of the graph.
      
Just select your line by pressing a radio-button or selecting an editfield.
      
Then select your property to plot and set your desired top value for the graph and press the set button.
       
Pressing ReRead reloads the current settings.
     
Choose the stepsize 1-4 from the options menu.
         
Bigger steps make less points in the curve.
 
Choose your resolution 400-800 points from the options menu.      
      
When going from more to less points will delete exessive points.
  
Going to more points can sometimes produce artifacts at the start of the curve which will roll of the sreen in a while.

For tickmarks, set above 0. A setting of 0 switches them off.
      
Currently only points are implemented.
      
Even a Save/Load button to save settings and get them back in place fast, to save a lot of time searching for the right props.
